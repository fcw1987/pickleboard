# Asset provenance

Current visual assets are original Pickleball Park artwork authored in this repository. No Nintendo/Pokémon assets, fonts, logos, extracted panels, sound, or music are used. DS Diamond/Pearl is an art-direction reference only.

Palette: visual-theme.js. Sprite/icon source: `tools/generate-art.mjs`, authored pixels encoded to PNG with Node standard library. Run `node tools/generate-art.mjs` to regenerate all four 48×48 RGBA players, eleven icon variants, and QA sheets in assets/source. No raster/image library or remote input. 48-pixel drawing selected over 32-pixel resampling for readable cap, hand and paddle. Green front/orange rear follow existing orientation; physical handedness uses authored placement, no mirrored text. Existing Three.js vendor files and their existing license notices remain unchanged. No project license change is made. Typography uses installed system fonts; no font files or remote requests.

Visual reference consulted: [original Diamond/Pearl DS town screenshot](https://www.vgchartz.com/game/4022/pokemon-diamond-pearl-version/screenshots). Reference only, not downloaded into runtime or copied. It informed compact proportions, restrained palette and crisp spatial edges.

## Second-pass revision

Commit `3871440` reauthors the original player pixels and adds `assets/source/players-poses.png` (front, genuine side profile, rear, extended swing). The four runtime PNG filenames remain unchanged. Navy clothing, broad team panels and the 46/48 visible-sole edge are shared with the projected editor and compact 3D rig. Source pixels occupy rows through 45; row edge 46 is the placement anchor. Court artwork now uses a 4×4-foot upright presentation box rather than the first pass's 4×3 box. `node tools/generate-art.mjs` reproduces the assets without an image library, external model or remote input. Existing icons and their original provenance remain unchanged.

Procedural 3D shapes and pose changes are repository-authored code in `three-d-playback.js` and `three-d-animation.js`. The SVG projection, net and slab are original local geometry. No new third-party artwork or license is introduced.

## Pixel actor replay revision

The visible procedural athletes are superseded by original layered pixel art from `tools/generate-replay-art.mjs`. It draws body/action pixels directly using the local Pickleball Park palette and character family; it does not render the rejected 3D model. Eight directions, physical handedness, two teams, and stroke phases are generated reproducibly. Runtime: `assets/replay/metadata.json` and 32 deduplicated PNGs (71,299 bytes); source/QA previews: `assets/source/replay-actors-preview.png` and `replay-actors-close.png`. Generator inputs are repository code, not external art. No licensing changes, paid tools, external services, new dependencies, or copied artwork. See `PIXEL_ACTOR_ASSETS.md` for frame/pivot/anchor conventions.

## Unified pixel park revision (accepted pre-rebrand baseline)

The prior paragraphs record historical assets. Current editor PNGs are **64×64**, exported directly from the approved replay ready body/action layers, pivot `(32,54)`. Run `node tools/generate-replay-art.mjs` then `node tools/generate-art.mjs`. The replay generator now includes lob and overhead preparation/contact/follow/recovery frames; existing liked grip/body art is preserved. Metadata describes 35 actions and 1,120 direction/team/hand frames in 32 deduplicated PNGs (88,591 bytes; metadata 312,149 bytes).

`tools/generate-park-art.mjs` authors seven local PNGs (2,330 bytes total): sparse court clusters, grass and path textures, tree, shrub, bench and sign. Source arrangement is `park-layout.js`; rendering adapters are `park-scene.js`. No random runtime texture generation, external image input, copied Nintendo art, remote fonts, new dependency or license change. Generator source is the reproducible original asset source.

## Pickleball Park rebrand (current)

The permanent product name is Pickleball Park. The 64×64 park sign is authored by `tools/generate-park-art.mjs` with original 3×5 pixel glyphs spelling `PICKLEBALL` above `PARK`. It replaces two unlabeled sign strokes, not a third-party font. Sign PNG: 214→306 bytes; the seven park PNGs total 2,422 bytes. Bounds, palette, world placement and pivot are unchanged.

Inspection found no old PB lettering in the approved replay athletes, editor composites, caps, paddle faces or icon emblem. Those assets, all 1,120 frame records, 32 atlas files, four editor PNGs, eleven icons and source sheets are unchanged. All three generators reproduce their outputs; the only runtime artwork delta is the sign. The historical before/after inspection remains local; the original source sheets remain in `assets/source/`. No license, ownership, dependency, asset service or font installation changed.
