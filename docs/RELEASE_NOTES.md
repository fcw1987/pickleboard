# Pickleball Park, pixel park baseline for live testing

The owner approved the rebrand on desktop and authorized delivery through the existing repository and Pages path. This sanitized public snapshot carries the approved runtime plus deliberately selected maintainer documentation and five reviewed app-only stills in [rebrand verification](REBRAND_VERIFICATION.md). It is a release candidate for live testing, not a stable 1.0 announcement.

## Permanent product name

Pickleball Park, formerly Pickleboard, is an interactive pickleball coaching and strategy app with an editable tactical board, guided lessons, and spatial replay in one original pixel art park. The full name appears in the interface, install manifest, source-authored park sign, and current documentation. New project-owned package identity is `pickleballpark`.

The existing install start URL, worker registration and scope, theme preference, and internal compatibility contracts remain stable. The current cache version updates local assets without changing install identity or deleting unrelated storage.

## Accumulated change from public main

The current public main baseline is `e67d060ca44a3c27af346007e619927bc6e3c9a1`. The visually accepted runtime source is `f89cdfd`; this sanitized snapshot deliberately carries that approved runtime through a clean publication route rather than publishing its original development ancestry.

Compared with public main, the accepted runtime includes an elevated editable SVG court with precise inverse dragging and drawing projection; original directional pixel athletes in the editor and spatial replay with connected grips; a textured park and consistent landmarks; one canonical court definition with service centerlines outside the kitchens; continuous rally flight and camera-independent facing; and a high-contrast outlined ball with restrained tracking cues.

The shared timeline supplies eight illustrative lessons: Serve & Return, Third Shot Drop, Third Shot Drive, Fifth Shot Drop, Dink Exchange, Volley & Block, Short-Hop Reset, and Lob & Overhead. Loop, responsive transport and instruction panels, readable shot cues, interruption-safe pause/resume, snapshot restoration, lazy-loading cancellation, recoverable failure paths, and demand rendering are included. These examples are not a complete officiating engine, physical simulation, or biomechanics model.

## Compatibility and known limits

The worker remains at `sw.js` with the existing scope and `./index.html` start URL. The accepted runtime uses cache version v15 in the retained compatibility namespace; the existing theme key remains compatible. Only theme preference persists across reloads; player arrangements, drawings, and handedness are session-only.

Local rebrand checks recorded 122 Chromium browser tests, 49 unit tests, and 77 asset checks. WebKit recorded 115 passes and seven documented offline-emulation/cache failures. These historical local counts are context only; hosted CI and the actual public-main-to-snapshot migration still require verification. Native Safari, installation, and physical phone/tablet behavior are outside the claims made here. No universal performance guarantee is made.

The public evidence intentionally excludes recordings, raw test logs, browser metadata, local machine paths, and redundant historical evidence. The retained stills establish the visible board, guided, 3D replay, menu, and help states; they do not claim frame-accurate video behavior or physical-device coverage.

## Release preparation

Suggested release title: **Pickleball Park — unified pixel park coaching and rebrand**. Keep the existing repository and Pages URLs until a coordinated rename is separately approved and tested. See [public release snapshot](RELEASE_PUBLICATION_SUMMARY.md), [rename handoff](RENAME_HANDOFF.md), and [coaching verification](PARK_COACHING_VERIFICATION.md).
