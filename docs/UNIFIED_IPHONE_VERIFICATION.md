# Unified iPhone builder candidate

Verified against the completed `4816210` court-centered source, which already contains `d9b75d7` from draft PR #16. No equivalent patches or archived private development history were merged. Runtime checkpoint: `7bfb7ddf49627aae29e326ff3342c4e0e2f8ca38`; final package uses this exact runtime fixture. This is an isolated successor draft candidate, not a production deployment.

## Preserved and newly implemented

Preserved: compact File/Plays grouping, contextual inspector, direct paused target dragging, explicit cancellation, hidden target guard, Preview destination only acknowledgement, eight lessons, one playhead, Loop, planner restoration, original characters/grips/ball/park, demand rendering and local backup format. The earlier court-centered pass is not claimed as new work.

New: shared shallow phone editor (family, hitter, target, flight) with full scrollable Details; per-player movement destination and pin editing through the existing compiler; coherent offcourt movement bounds; 44 CSS-pixel phone controls where practical; visual-viewport/safe-area adaptation; recoverable invalid fields and imports; local conflict detection; and cancellation on loss of pointer ownership or changed projection. Exact coordinates are displayed to three decimals while unedited source/export values remain unchanged. The schema remains version 1 with an optional `playerMovement` map: old builds cannot faithfully preview those additional partner commands. See [schema](BUILDER_SCHEMA.md).

## Phone workflow and evidence

Before: open the inspector and work through small stacked fields; partner movement was not fully authored through the visible interface; narrow placement left too little court. After: select a shot, use the shallow card, tap Place target (or drag an already visible paused target), then Cancel or finish one gesture. Details provides receiver/contact/serve options, exact values, Moving player, intent, destination and pin. Done closes committed undoable changes; it is not a destructive cancel. File holds saved work/import/export; Plays holds lessons/planner/new draft.

The recorded test authors a named custom rally, changes serve placement, edits the return, selects a drive as shot three, adds a fourth shot, changes partner movement, toggles assistance/guides, undoes/redoes, reloads, visits a lesson and returns through Planner. It asserts four valid compiled shots before playback and exact saved document equality on return.

Captures are application-only Chromium desktop emulation. State gallery uses DPR1; touch workflow uses DPR2, with additional DPR3 input coverage. The video is a short accelerated authoring walkthrough with ordinary playback timing, not a claimed human-paced tutorial or runtime FPS measurement. Chronological 0.5-second decoded frames were independently inspected; this is not frame-exhaustive video inspection. [Enlarged text](iphone-builder/phone-200-text.png) uses the retained readable vertical reflow (scrolling is required at 200%); [dark tablet details](iphone-builder/tablet-dark-details.png) and [wide desktop](iphone-builder/wide-desktop.png) were also inspected. No physical iPhone/iPad, actual Safari, VoiceOver, hardware keyboard or installed-PWA acceptance is claimed. Keyboard-height changes are simulated. Playback gallery frames occur shortly after 0.6 seconds, so only paused opening/placement comparisons are exact-time matches.

## Court and camera measurements

Painted court polygon in CSS square pixels, canonical four court corners projected into the actual viewport. Same starting draft and named camera; the new wide-view angle is explicitly different. Grass/canvas area does not count.

| Viewport | State | Before | After | Change |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 390×844 | browse | 63,708 | 54,054 | -15.2% |
| 390×844 | placement | 53,981 | 78,455 | +45.3% |

Phone placement improves by temporarily hiding sequence/assistance chrome; cancelling restores it. The 390px browse court is smaller because readable native inputs and touch controls use more height. Tablet/desktop camera changes from `[12,16,1.5]` to `[12,16,3.5]` reveal the net and separation; the deliberate framing cost is reported rather than claimed as area improvement. Portrait camera identity remains. All existing presets remain available. No court dimensions or tactical positions changed.

## Reliability and regression evidence

- Two tabs could overwrite the same saved draft. Saves now compare the observed stored version; a conflict preserves the in-memory work and offers Save a copy. Quota failure retains Retry; unrelated drafts do not conflict. The new old-source reproduction fails against `4816210` and passes on the candidate.
- Imported IDs could replace a saved draft. Imports now create a copy identity; invalid imports retain the text and error. The old-source regression demonstrates the overwrite.
- Pending title text could be lost on backgrounding. Completed fields blur/commit before page hide; an old-source regression demonstrates the loss. Local save status distinguishes pending editing, success and failure.
- Gesture interruption could leave stale ownership. Pointer cancellation, lost capture, second touch, resize, shot change, playback and view transitions clear the operation. Tests preserve exact coordinates and Undo; native touch tests activate the real placement control before sampling its resized projection.
- Future movement pins incorrectly influenced earlier coverage. Protection now follows shot order; current/manual and persistent locks remain authoritative. Tests compare the same earlier result before/after a future pin and preserve the later exact destination.
- WebKit exposed a stale Pause label at final-event completion: a live-state toggle could restart instead of pause. The button now requests an explicit state. A deterministic regression fails before the correction and passes in both engines; the phone workflow restarts before its measured playback interval and asserts exact paused time across views.
- Full browser testing caught landscape imported-status overlap with Add shot. Status is bounded and scrollable, the collapsed editor is compact, and the actual import/add workflow now passes.
- Visual review caught narrow placement, sheet/menu overlap, floating-point noise and clipped Restart text. Corrected with a focused placement layout, closed-menu stacking, display-only precision formatting and compact label padding.

Saved source remains separate from presentation. Autosave does not write frame samples. Library records are cached until edits/storage events instead of reparsing all stored plays per rendered frame. Intermediate waypoints remain in imports/exports, require explicit Preview destination only acknowledgement and are not claimed as animated paths. Partner waypoint metadata follows the same gate.

## Performance and package

Matched headless Chromium 149 on macOS/SwiftShader software rendering, 1440×900 DPR1, starter draft, overhead, 1× Loop; two 30-second samples after two logical seconds of warmup. Baseline readiness 826/763 ms; candidate 846/779 ms. Encoded resource bytes 1,556,483 → 1,582,744. RAF median 8.8 → 8.4 ms, p95 16.9 → 16.7/16.7 ms, p99 17.5/17.2 → 16.8/16.8 ms. Interval proportion above 1.5× observed median: 44.3/45.3% → 37.5/37.5%; bimodal automation cadence means this is not a demonstrated displayed-frame-rate gain. CPU render submission median 0.3 ms, p95 0.4 ms unchanged; p99 0.5 ms unchanged. No trustworthy GPU completion or physical phone performance measurement is claimed.

Measurements were captured at pause-corrected `30c8a36`; final `7bfb7dd` changes only the number field display from six to three decimal places, with unchanged byte count and playback paths.

Resources unchanged: 43 geometries, 17 textures, 57 draw calls; zero paused frames during the one-second settled sample. [Before measurements](iphone-builder/performance-before.json), [after](iphone-builder/performance-after.json). Runtime package: 93 paths, 1,599,946 → 1,626,442 bytes (+26,496; about 1.65%). No assets, production dependencies or new runtime paths added. [Complete runtime comparison](iphone-builder/runtime-comparison.json); frozen manifest digest `d1f19dd68bd834ba4a2b37bb7c679932c1c3f32ee6e8e5211174abcab2cca0b6`.

Service worker advances v18→v19 under the same owned namespace; stable registration/scope/start URL/theme key and draft keys retained. Package validation serves the [existing Pages path](https://fcw1987.github.io/pickleboard/), tests fresh install plus the older public fixture, actual current preview `d9b75d7`/v17, and immediate `4816210`/v18, each in Chromium/WebKit. It verifies hashes, existing open editing state, saved custom source, theme and unrelated caches, then stops the server and opens all eight lessons plus custom work offline. No global cache clearing.

## Checks and independent review

Baseline: `npm run check` 134 unit tests; full Chromium 168 passes. Candidate: `npm ci` succeeds with unchanged dependencies; `npm run check` 146 units, syntax, 90 static paths and brand checks pass; `npm run check:generated` reproduces 63 asset paths. Focused corrected authoring/input 35/35 and phone recording 1/1 pass. Full local Chromium at pause-corrected `30c8a36`: **189/189 passed**. The final display-only formatting change reran all four phone tests successfully; hosted CI checks the exact final candidate. `npm run build:site && npm run verify:package`: **8/8 clean-install/upgrade cases passed**, including all eight stopped-server offline lessons and custom draft reload in each case. [Package results](iphone-builder/package-verification.json). Full local WebKit: **182 passed, seven failed with the existing offline-emulation/cache signatures**. All new iPhone tests pass. Those seven failures are reported, not called local passes; the Linux CI gate separately requires the strict established diagnostic policy.

Luna (`gpt-5.6-luna`) implemented shared UI and reviewed actual images/chronological clip samples. Sol (`gpt-5.6-sol`) implemented save and input ownership, reviewed domain integrity and independently verified packaging. Astra integrated and inspected the diff/rendered output; authors' reports were not used as substitutes for combined tests. Review corrections are listed above. [Apple/WCAG source-to-change guidance](IPHONE_INTERFACE_GUIDANCE.md) distinguishes browser standards from native platform behavior.

The strict WebKit infrastructure policy remains tied to seven exact test/signature pairs, unchanged browser version, independent no-app diagnostics, retries, protected file hashes and review expiry. New/unmatched failures block CI; it is not blanket allow-failure. Current service-worker test hashes/counts were updated only for v19 and the added tests. [Tracked infrastructure issue](https://github.com/fcw1987/pickleboard/issues/14).

A new WebKit quota-test failure was traced to assigning a method on its exotic Storage instance, which did not inject the intended exception. The test now supplies an explicit storage adapter and asserts a failed write occurred; all original state/retry checks remain. The four save tests pass on WebKit. This is not a new infrastructure exception.

## Review and handoff

Local preview: http://127.0.0.1:4173/ . On a phone-sized viewport: Edit shot → target → tap or Cancel; Details → Moving player → manual pin; play/pause and switch 2D/3D; use File to save/export/reopen and Plays to visit Planner. Confirm useful touch reach, real keyboard avoidance, rotation and physical-device smoothness during owner acceptance.

Authoritative branch: `integration/unified-iphone-builder`. PR #16 and its `feature/visual-play-builder` Pages source remain untouched. The successor draft PR is the only candidate for this mission; its exact checks/artifact are linked in the delivery report. No merge, force push, branch deletion, deployment or settings change is authorized/performed. Future work should start from this clean public lineage, never archived private history.
