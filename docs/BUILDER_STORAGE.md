# Builder storage contract

The builder saves authored source documents synchronously in browser `localStorage` under the dedicated key `pickleballpark-builder-v1`. It does not store playback samples, playhead state, camera preferences, theme preference, or service-worker cache data. Incomplete documents are valid storage inputs when the document validator accepts them.

The stored value is one versioned JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "drafts": [],
  "lastId": null
}
```

Writing the complete envelope with one `setItem` call is the commit point. A quota or storage failure leaves the previously committed envelope intact. Malformed or unsupported stored data is reported and kept verbatim for recovery; the module never silently deletes it. Version 1 is the only supported storage-envelope version. A future envelope requires an explicit migration before it can be opened.

`DraftStore` receives the play document's `validateDocument` function through its constructor. This keeps persistence independent of the compiler while making every save, open, import, and export pass the production schema validator. The store additionally rejects cyclic or non-plain values, dangerous prototype keys, non-finite numbers, documents without bounded string identity/title fields, JSON over 512 KiB, and libraries over 50 drafts. The document validator owns the complete schema, including schema version 1, the 64-shot maximum, enums, coordinate bounds, plain-text policy, and rejection of URL/HTML-shaped fields.

JSON import only returns a validated detached document; callers choose whether to save it. JSON export emits only the validated source document. Browser storage remains local to the current browser profile and origin and is not an absolute backup, so export is the durable manual backup path.

`EditHistory` stores detached source snapshots. `commit` drops the redo branch, `undo` and `redo` return clones, and the configured limit bounds retained undo transitions. Playback frames and derived compiler output must never be committed. The integrating session decides which user operations form a single authored edit and separately marks dependent later shots for review.

## Intermediate movement paths

Version 1 retains imported `movement.waypoints` verbatim but only animates the final destination. The controller requires a session-only **Preview destination only** acknowledgement before advancing such a document. Affected path changes invalidate that acknowledgement; reload asks again. This does not migrate or rewrite source data. See [usability verification](COURT_CENTERED_BUILDER.md).
